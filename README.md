# NYCDensityMapper

Using NYC government APIs, SQL, Python, and a little bit of zoning, I develop a map of New York City's density per acre by every residential block. 

In our current climate crisis, density is one of humanity's true remaining silver bullets to reduce our carbon footprint. Knowing which locations are the densest in our 8.5 million-strong city will help us where to most effectively allocate our resources. Many top urban planners and architects understand that a minimum level of density is a prerequisite to successful urban, transit-oriented development. Hopefully, this data will prove useful in the future of our city, and the future of cities around the world where such data is equally available and can make an equally profound impact on building a sustainable urban future.
