# How to Get Zoning by the Tax Lot Data

In order for this project to work, I had to come up with a way to systematically and quickly import data on <b>all</b> of NYC's numerous tax lots that make up the fabric of its street system.

Thankfully, David Chen (<a href="https://github.com/TheEgghead27">Github</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-lin-chen/">LinkedIn</a>) was able to come up with a way to do this in relatively quick time. Without his initial contribution to the journey, the rest of it would not be possible.
